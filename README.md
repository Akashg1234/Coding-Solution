It can be done using linear search and devide and conqure rule with structure/ class 

## Maximum sum sub array
It can be done using dynamic programming

## Chocolate Distribution problem
Given an array of n integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

    1. Each student gets one packet.
    2. The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is m        inimum.
An efficient solution is based on the observation that to minimize the difference, we must choose consecutive elements from a sorted packet. We first sort the array arr[0..n-1], then find the subarray of size m with the minimum difference between the last and first elements.

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Balanced Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

## Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Path Sum

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

## Path sum 2

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

## Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

## Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.
